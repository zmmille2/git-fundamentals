# Git Fundamentals Workshop
Zach Miller

## Introduction

Welcome to the Git Fundamentals Workshop!
We'll get you started with using git, and cover the first couple basic workflows that should get you off the ground.

To get started, we'll talk about the [software that you'll need installed, and the account you'll need registered](topics/00-installation-and-registration.md) to get set up for working with `git` and Github.

Alternatively, if you're coming back to the course, please feel free to navigate using the table of contents:
