# Git Fundamentals Workshop
By Zach Miller

## Introduction

Welcome to the Git Fundamentals Workshop!
We'll get you started with using git, and cover the first couple basic workflows that should get you off the ground.

To get started, we'll talk about the [software that you'll need installed, and the account you'll need registered](topics/00-installation-and-registration.md) to get set up for working with `git` and Github. Make sure to do this step before the workshop.

If you're looking for materials on the theory and inner workings of `git`, there are myriad materials all over the internet that explain things better than I could.
As such, I've linked them throughout the material.
If you're looking for a link and don't want to search through everything, you can alternatively just visit [the references writeup](topics/05-references.md).

Alternatively, if you're coming back to the middle of the workshop, please feel free to navigate using the table of contents:
