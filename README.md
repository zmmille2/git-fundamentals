# Git Fundamentals Workshop
Zach Miller

## Introduction

Welcome to the Git Fundamentals Workshop!
We'll get you started with using git, and cover the first couple basic workflows that should get you off the ground.

To get started, we'll talk about the [software that you'll need installed, and the account you'll need registered](topics/00-installation-and-registration.md) to get set up for working with `git` and Github.

If you already have worked with `git` in the past and know the basics of how to use the tool, but want to cover more of the theory, start with [Commits](04-commits.md)

Alternatively, if you're coming back to the middle of the workshop, please feel free to navigate using the table of contents:
