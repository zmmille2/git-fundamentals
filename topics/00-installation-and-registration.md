# Installation and Registration
First, let's make sure that you have all the tools you need to run this workshop.

## Install software
Obviously you'll need `git`:
The best way to get this is to just follow [the instructions on the official `git` website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

You can either use this course with a terminal and a text editor, with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), or with some mix of both.
VSCode has some nice UI elements to play with to get started, and also an integrated terminal to poke around a little more intentionally, so make sure you have that installed, too.

## Register for a Github account
If you don't already have one, [make a Github account](https://github.com/join).
Here's where you'll choose your username.
This may be the hardest part of the course.

### What's the difference between `git` and Github?
While it will likely seem like everything plays together really nicely, technically `git` is a tool independent of Github the website.
Everything that Github provides for us could technically be provided by any server - this is part of the magic of the decentralized nature of `git`.

Since this course is about `git` fundamentals, we'll focus on functionality that `git` provides to us, but since Github is the de facto hub of `git`, lots of our examples will use screenshots of Github, but there are certainly competitors.
[Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) also use `git`, for example, and you can even [run your own `git` server](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/how-run-your-own-git-server/).

## [Optional] Setup your `ssh` key
`ssh` stands for **S**ecure **Sh**ell.
It's a secure way to connect to servers.
While Github can use `HTTPS` to have you login with your Github credentials on clone, you can also use an `ssh` key to verify your identity and clone files securely.
To set up your `ssh` key, please follow [this great blog post](https://devconnected.com/how-to-setup-ssh-keys-on-github/).
