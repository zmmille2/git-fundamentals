Thank you so much for running through this course!
I hope it was helpful.

If you have suggestions, complaints, requests, or comments, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/zmmille2/git-fundamentals/issues) and I'll be sure to have a look.
Alternatively, you could always just [make a pull request](https://github.com/zmmille2/git-fundamentals/pulls) now that you know how! ðŸ˜‰
I'd appreciate the help in keeping this a good resource for other developers learning `git` for the first time, and I'm sure they'd appreciate any improvements you'd suggest or make.
